## Description

Shop Shop is an ecommerce application that the user can use to buy many different products. When the product is clicked on the user can see a larger picture and description of the product. The user can also add and remove products from their cart which persists from online to offline. Once the user logs in then they can checkout, which redirects them to a Stripe page where they can input the required information and purchase the products.
